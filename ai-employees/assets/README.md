# Assets

The employee artwork is hosted on the club so the README and every employee README load it live, and a redesign there reaches this repo without a commit:

| Image | URL |
|---|---|
| The eight, one collage | `https://club.reinventing.ai/img/employees/ai-employees-collage.webp` |
| One employee, 1600 by 900 | `https://club.reinventing.ai/img/employees/<slug>.webp` |
| One employee, square thumbnail | `https://club.reinventing.ai/img/employees/thumbs/<slug>.webp` |

The README wordmark is `logo-light.png` and `logo-dark.png`, 1680 by 400 with a transparent ground, shown at `width="480"` inside a `picture` tag so each GitHub theme gets its own: navy for light, cream for dark. Eight tiles, one per role, the last one lit in signal blue. Both render from `src/logo.html` (add `#dark` to the URL for the cream one) with `--window-size=840,200` and keep their two times pixels.

The four header buttons are `btn-install.png`, `btn-join.png`, `btn-sessions.png` and `btn-club.png`, one image each so each keeps its own link and its own `utm_content`. They are 60 tall and as wide as their own text (260, 199, 163 and 186), rendered at three times scale from `src/header-buttons.html` with `#install`, `#join`, `#sessions` or `#club` on the URL and `--window-size=<width>,60`. The club's three colours carry the order of importance: cream for the primary action, signal blue for the second, navy for the two that follow. Every button has a rim, so cream holds on GitHub's light theme and navy on its dark one.

`harness-strip.png` is the compatibility strip in the README header: 838 by 92, rendered at three times scale. It shows the thirteen agents in `docs/HARNESSES.md`, in that order, each brand's own favicon on a white tile so a dark mark never disappears into the navy. It renders from `src/harness-strip.html`, which reads the icons from the club repository checked out beside this one (`agent-ops-club/public/img/harnesses`). Rebuild it with `--allow-file-access-from-files --force-device-scale-factor=3 --window-size=838,92`. Adding a harness means adding it to `docs/HARNESSES.md`, to the list in that page, and to the alt text in the README.

Three more images live in this folder; the first two and are built from the same eight square thumbnails:

| File | What it is | Where it goes |
|---|---|---|
| `banner.png` | 1600 by 400. The eight, named, on the navy ground, beside the one line promise. | Not in the README since the wordmark header replaced it. Kept for the club and for social posts. |
| `social-preview.png` | 1280 by 640. The same eight under the repo name, with the GitHub URL. | The repository settings, under Social preview. GitHub does not read it from the tree, so upload it by hand after a change. |
| `cta-install-prompt.png` | 660 by 104, the club's own primary button at two times scale. Shown at `width="330"`, so it stays crisp on a retina screen. | The README, in the install prompt block above What sets these AI Employees apart. |

Both are rendered from the pages in `src/` in headless Chrome at two times scale and downsampled, with Montserrat for the display line, Inter for text and JetBrains Mono for the eyebrow, which are the club's own three faces. No gradient text. To rebuild one:

```
chrome --headless=new --hide-scrollbars --force-device-scale-factor=2 --window-size=1600,400 --virtual-time-budget=8000 --default-background-color=00000000 --screenshot=banner@2x.png assets/src/banner.html
```

then downsample to 1600 by 400. The social preview is the same with `--window-size=1280,640`, no transparent background, and 1280 by 640 at the end. The button is `--window-size=330,52` and keeps its two times pixels rather than being downsampled, because GitHub renders an `img` at `height: auto` and will only ever scale one down:

```
chrome --headless=new --hide-scrollbars --force-device-scale-factor=2 --window-size=330,52 --virtual-time-budget=8000 --default-background-color=00000000 --screenshot=assets/cta-install-prompt.png assets/src/cta-install-prompt.html
```

The button is cream on a navy rim rather than cream alone, because GitHub's light theme washes out an unrimmed cream fill.

Still to make:

| File | What it is | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| `org-chart.png` | The eight employees as an org chart, with each one's cadence under its name. | 1280 by 640. Navy ground `#0D161B`, cream type `#f1e8cb`, signal blue accents `#0b7fc7`. No gradient text. |
| `demo.gif` | Twenty seconds, no sound: paste the install prompt into Claude Code, watch the routines register, cut to the next morning's brief opening. Recorded on the fictional business in `employees/gtm-engineer/examples/`, never on a real one. | Under 6 MB. Terminal on navy. |

Two rules for anything that lands here: no generated face of anyone, and nothing recorded against a real customer, a real contact, or a real account screen.
