/*
 * copy-check.mjs
 * The scripted judge for any text about to be written into a brief, a report,
 * a change brief, a policy file, or a dashboard partial.
 *
 * The script is the judge, not a reading of the file. A stated preference has
 * never been enough: every rule below exists because the same defect shipped
 * at least once.
 *
 * Requires Node 18 or newer. No dependencies, no package.json, no install.
 * Runs the same on Windows and POSIX.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/copy-check.mjs --file <path> --dest <destination> [--json]
 *   node scripts/copy-check.mjs --file - --dest plain        (reads stdin)
 *   node scripts/copy-check.mjs --file <path> --secrets-only [--json]
 *   node scripts/copy-check.mjs --selftest
 *   node scripts/copy-check.mjs --help
 *
 *   --dest is one of: plain, brief, report, change, policy, dashboard
 *   There is no --profile, no --destination, and no bare positional path.
 *   Any call site using one of those is stale and this script will say so.
 *
 *   --secrets-only is the secret.scan route. It runs rule 6 and nothing else,
 *   so a raw production log line can be scanned for a credential without
 *   being judged as prose. It takes no --dest. Use it before a log excerpt,
 *   a build failure reason, a package manager output line, or a diff is
 *   copied into any file in this kit.
 *
 * OPTIONS
 *   --json          Print a machine readable verdict instead of a report.
 *   --quiet         Print nothing. Use the exit code.
 *
 * THIS SCRIPT READS NO OTHER FILE. It judges the text it is handed and
 * nothing else, so it behaves identically on a fresh install and on a kit
 * that has been running for a year. There is no vocabulary file to fall out
 * of date and no inventory of approved numbers to keep.
 *
 * WHAT IT FAILS, in the order it checks
 *   1. An em dash or an en dash anywhere, including inside a code comment,
 *      and the HTML entity spellings of both.
 *   2. A metric shaped digit sequence (a percentage, a currency amount, a
 *      multiplier, or a count of errors, incidents, checks, packages, days,
 *      or people) unless the line it sits on also names the file the number
 *      was counted in. A date, an ISO week, a clock time, and a card id are
 *      masked out first and are never read as a claim.
 *   3. An unresolved guillemet placeholder. This kit has no sentinels: every
 *      guillemet in a generated file is a value that did not get filled.
 *   4. A banned word, banned opener, or banned closer.
 *   5. A hashtag. Nothing this Employee writes has one.
 *   6. A secret shaped substring. Reports the class and the file name only,
 *      never the matched text.
 *   7. A dotted token left bare in prose, which a publishing platform's
 *      autolinker rewrites into a broken link. OFF in every profile here:
 *      this Employee publishes nothing, and a bare domain name is its
 *      subject matter. See the note above rule 7 in the source.
 *
 * WHICH RULES APPLY WHERE
 *   rule          plain  brief  report  change  policy  dashboard
 *   dash            y      y      y       y       y        y
 *   metric          y      y      y       y       y        y
 *   placeholder     y      y      y       y       y        y
 *   secret          y      y      y       y       y        y
 *   voice           y      y      y       y       n        y
 *   hashtag         y      y      y       y       n        n
 *   autolink        n      n      n       n       n        n
 *
 *   Every routine in this kit calls --dest plain, which is the strictest
 *   profile and the right default. The other five exist so a member can
 *   loosen one surface without loosening all of them.
 *
 *   policy skips the voice rules because policy/safe-fix-rules.md is a table
 *   of rung names rather than prose, and a checker that fails a boundary file
 *   is a checker that gets turned off. dashboard skips hashtag and autolink
 *   because a hex colour and a markup attribute are not prose.
 *
 * EXIT CODES
 *   0  clean
 *   1  one or more violations
 *   2  bad usage, or the input could not be read
