# What it costs to run

This is the first question anyone asks. The short answer: on a Claude subscription, nothing beyond the subscription. The long answer is below, measured on one employee as the worked example, the GTM Engineer, with the dates, the method and the price table so you can check it. Nothing on this page is an estimate except where it says so.

## The short version

- **On a Claude Pro or Max plan, an employee costs no dollars.** It runs inside Claude Code on your own seat, which is also what the browser lane needs. What it spends is a share of your plan's usage limits.
- **How big a share, measured on one employee as the example:** over ten days, 2026-08-27 to 2026-09-05, the GTM Engineer's scheduled runs were about **6 percent** of everything this machine sent to Claude. The other 94 percent was me working in Claude Code all day. One employee is a small slice of one Max seat, and by that measure a seat carries several employees alongside a working day. Anthropic publishes no token quota per plan, so that is a measurement of my machine, not a promise about yours.
- **On an API key, for reference:** about **$19** of Opus 5 usage at list price on a plain weekday, about **$27** on Monday and Friday, about **$500 a month** for one employee. Two thirds of that is cache reads, because every turn re-reads the kit's documents. An API key also loses the browser lane, so it is the expensive way to run these, not the normal one.
- **The runs behind these numbers used `claude-opus-5`** with the 1M context window, through the Claude Desktop app's scheduler.
- **A skipped fire** on a live install costs about **$0.90 to $1.10** of API equivalent usage and 1.3 to 2.2 minutes, because the session still starts, loads the routine and reads the schedule before it exits. `scripts/guard.mjs` runs before the routine's documents are read and should cut that; the re-measured number will follow.
- **Install day** cost about **$68** API equivalent in an operator session.

## Where the numbers come from

The GTM Engineer is the example employee. Every scheduled `gtm-*` session the Claude Desktop app started between 2026-08-26 and 2026-09-04: 42 sessions, each with a transcript. Each transcript was summed per assistant message, deduplicated by message id, and priced at API list rates. 27 are clean scheduled runs and make the table below. Excluded from the means: 8 skipped fires, listed separately, and 7 sessions that turned into operator sessions rather than scheduled runs. The whole seat comparison sums every assistant message in every Claude Code transcript on the same seat over the same window, 15,875 messages, priced at Opus 5 rates for all of them, which understates the seat total because a share of those messages ran on a dearer model. So 6 percent is a ceiling on the employee's share.

Prices used, per million tokens: Opus 5 input $5, output $25, cache write $6.25, cache read $0.50. Flat pricing was applied to the 1M context model.

## One employee as the example: the GTM Engineer, per routine, Opus 5 API list price

| Routine | Clean runs | Mean | Min | Max | Mean output tokens | Mean cache read tokens | Mean turns | Mean wall minutes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gtm-signal-sweep | 6 | $4.38 | $3.42 | $5.86 | 28,191 | 5.81 M | 48 | 9.8 |
| gtm-board-standup | 5 | $5.54 | $4.94 | $6.44 | 55,385 | 6.47 M | 47 | 12.6 |
| gtm-outreach-queue | 6 | $3.35 | $2.21 | $4.24 | 19,872 | 4.22 M | 33 | 5.9 |
| gtm-launch-step-runner | 6 | $6.22 | $4.22 | $9.68 | 31,500 | 8.86 M | 57 | 10.8 |
| gtm-paid-and-tracking-guard | 1 | $7.16 | | | 50,822 | 9.73 M | 69 | 24.0 |
| gtm-scoreboard | 2 | $7.50 | $7.37 | $7.64 | 51,771 | 10.09 M | 62 | 15.6 |
| gtm-intake-and-dashboard, monthly | 1 | $3.84 | | | 26,222 | 4.66 M | 36 | 7.7 |
| gtm-icp-refresh, monthly | 1 (an upper bound) | $4.84 | | | 37,396 | 4.85 M | 41 | |
| A skipped fire, any routine, live install | 8 | $0.99 | $0.88 | $1.14 | 3,984 to 6,055 | 0.88 to 1.19 M | 11 to 14 | 1.3 to 2.2 |

Cache reads are 66 percent of the clean runs' cost and output tokens 17 percent. Each turn re-reads the contract, the role, the capabilities file, the schedule and the routine's own instructions, roughly 225 KB of documents plus a 62 to 94 KB routine file. That is the single largest cost lever and it is the split described at the end of this page.

## Per day, per month

| Scope | Opus 5, API list price |
|---|---|
| Plain weekday (sweep, standup, outreach, step runner) | $19.49 |
| Monday (adds the paid guard) | $26.65 |
| Friday (adds the scoreboard) | $27.00 |
| One employee, 30 day month (22 weekdays, 4 Mondays, 4 Fridays, one intake, one refresh, a dozen skips) | about $500 |
| Install day, once | $68, warm operator session |

## What a subscription actually covers

Anthropic publishes no token or dollar quota per plan, so a plan cannot be mapped to the table exactly. What their pages say: the free plan does not include Claude Code; Pro and Max share usage across Claude and Claude Code; Max has a session limit that resets every five hours plus a weekly limit across all models. What my machine says: on a Max seat, the GTM Engineer's scheduled runs were 6 percent of ten days of heavy use, and the runs land at fixed times inside the same five hour windows a seat is used interactively.

The only way to turn the table into dollars is an API key, and an API key loses the browser lane, which most of these routines need. Run them on a seat.

## On Grok Bot

Grok Bot is metered differently: a plan carries a weekly usage allowance, and the bots draw it down. As of August 21, 2026, bots come with Cursor Pro+ at $60 a month, SuperGrok Plus at $100, Cursor Ultra at $200, SuperGrok Heavy at $300, and Cursor Teams at $40 a seat, with a limited free trial. What the price does not say is how fast the allowance moves under a fleet: operators running several bots on patrol report reaching it early in the week. The kits are not always on, which is the point. One Employee is a handful of runs a day, each inside a window and a budget, and a skipped fire exits before it reads the contract. Start on the lowest tier that includes bots, run one Employee for a week, and read the meter before you add a second. Nothing on this page was measured on Grok Bot; the numbers above are its published prices, and the measurement will follow the first install that reports.

## Making cost a field, not a guess

`scripts/runlog.mjs` accepts nine optional fields on a run record: `model`, `harness`, `turns`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, `cost_usd`, and `cost_basis` (`api-list`, `subscription`, or `unknown`). They are counts and prices only, never required, and the refusal rules on the rest of the record are untouched. On the CLI, `claude -p --output-format json` prints `total_cost_usd` and the token counts on exit; the launcher in `run/` writes that JSON to `run/<id>.last.json`. A flag that attaches those numbers to the record the routine just wrote is not built yet, and until it is the fields get filled by the routine's own last step where a harness exposes them, or stay absent.

## What is deferred, and said here so nobody assumes otherwise

- **The root documents are not yet split into a short law section read every run and a reference section read on demand.** That split is the single largest cost lever, because cache reads are two thirds of every run. The numbers on this page are the pre split numbers.
- **The skip cost with `guard.mjs` in front.** The mechanism is in place; the number will follow.
