# Release history

The repo version tracks the kits. Each employee carries its own `CHANGELOG.md` with the detail, and this file links them.

## 1.9.0, 2026-10-02

Prepared for release. GitHub publication and npm publication are separate maintainer steps.

- All eight employees gain verified progress, scoped blockers, bounded experiments, configured handoffs and recoverable claims using the existing 60 routines.
- The Chief of Staff separates delivery stalls from process failures and keeps unmeasured outcomes distinct from measured no-effect.
- SEO/AEO explicitly tracks Google Search Console Performance > Generative AI impressions, with native-report validation and separate Gemini/answer samples.
- The installer preserves true upgrade baselines and adds conservative, reviewable three-way reconciliation.
- Shared-source drift, scenario, upgrade and release checks run in CI.
- Kit changelogs: [GTM](employees/gtm-engineer/CHANGELOG.md), [Ad Manager](employees/ad-manager-employee/CHANGELOG.md), [SEO/AEO](employees/seo-employee/CHANGELOG.md), [Social](employees/social-media-employee/CHANGELOG.md), [Sales](employees/sales-employee/CHANGELOG.md), [Web Dev](employees/web-dev-employee/CHANGELOG.md), [Customer Satisfaction](employees/customer-satisfaction-employee/CHANGELOG.md), [Chief of Staff](employees/chief-of-staff/CHANGELOG.md). SEO/AEO is 1.10.0; the other kits are 1.9.0.


- **The plugin says what it runs, and the harness count is right.** The README gains a "What the plugin runs" paragraph: the one installer command, the self tests, the sign in check, no network request and no telemetry on the plugin path. The `hire` skill now asks before it fetches anything from npm or GitHub when it is used without the plugin. The README badge, the README line under "What sets these AI Employees apart", the installer's handover text and the `package.json` description said Claude Code and ten others; they now say twelve, which is the thirteen harnesses the docs name. The kit files are untouched, so this needs no kit release. The npm page shows the new description after the next publish.
- **Muse and Dots join the harness docs.** `docs/HARNESSES.md` gains a row for each: Muse (Meta's Muse Code and the Muse personal agent) and Dots (OpenAI's always on agents, announced September 29, 2026), with Dots added to the hosted shape section beside Grok Bot. The README strip, the prerequisites, install, FAQ and contributing pages now name thirteen harnesses. The kits themselves are unchanged.
- **A Claude Code plugin.** The repository root is now the plugin `ai-employees` and its own marketplace (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`). `/plugin marketplace add markfulton/ai-employees`, then `/plugin install ai-employees@ai-employees`, and `/ai-employees:hire` is available in every session. The plugin carries all eight kits and the installer, so a hire needs no download.
- **The `hire` skill, rewritten.** It now runs the bundled installer instead of copying by hand, so a skill hire writes `.installed.json` like an `npx` hire and a later upgrade can tell the member's edits from ours. It adds which employee to hire first, what to check the next weekday, the guardrails, and how a hired employee is directed, corrected, rescheduled and upgraded.

## 1.8.0, 2026-09-23

The Employees run on a hosted agent, and the brief reaches you wherever they run.

- **Grok Bot, written from the facts.** Every kit's `CAPABILITIES.md` section 2 row and paragraph for Grok Bot is rewritten from operators' published accounts of the product: every bot on an account shares one persistent cloud computer with a terminal, files and a browser; the kit lives on that computer and the bot installs it there; one bot per Employee with `AGENTS.md` pasted into its Instructions field; one recurring task per routine; sessions reach the bot only through a cookie sync you run, and every bot then shares every login, so bots are not a security boundary. Every Grok Bot row in sections 3 to 6 moves from `unknown` to a named route at `expected`. `docs/HARNESSES.md` gains a hosted harness section, and `docs/PREREQUISITES.md`, `docs/GUARDRAILS.md`, `docs/COST.md`, `docs/INSTALL.md` and `docs/FAQ.md` say the same in reader words.
- **`brief.deliver`, in every kit.** The standup brings `brief-latest.md` to you after it writes it: the dashboard on a machine you use, the Employee's own thread on a harness whose computer you never open, or your own address where a mail route exists. `CONTRACT.md` 3.2a carries the capability, `CAPABILITIES.md` section 6 the route per harness, and the standup routine the one delivery line. A brief to your own thread or address is delivery, not a send, and needs no release. Absent every route the file is the brief and the run record says `brief: file only`. The Agent Employee Standard moves to v1.4 for it.
- **Five questions before a routine exists**, in `docs/STANDARD.md` section 4 and the routine request in `CONTRIBUTING.md`: trigger, frequency, output, silence, stop.
- **Drift fixed.** Every kit's `AGENTS.md` carried a version number two releases behind `VERSION`; it now points at `VERSION` and says what to do with itself on a harness that has an Instructions field instead of a folder. Every `employee.json` listed seven harnesses where the docs promise eleven; Pi, Cline, Qwen Code and DeepSeek are now on the list.
- GTM Engineer, Ad Manager, Web Dev, Social Media, Sales, Customer Satisfaction and Chief of Staff move to 1.8.0; SEO/AEO to 1.9.0. See each kit's changelog, starting with [GTM Engineer](employees/gtm-engineer/CHANGELOG.md).

## 1.7.0, 2026-09-19

The Employees tell you when a newer kit is out, and offer their own repairs back to the project.

- **A monthly version check in every kit.** Each Employee's first weekday routine reads the published `VERSION` of its own kit. Where there is a newer one it writes what you get, in at most five plain lines, to `state/kit-update.json`, and the morning brief carries it under `## About this kit`: in full once per version, as a one line reminder once a month after that, closed by the two lines that take the update. **No routine runs the upgrade and no routine runs `npx`.** The fetched changelog is summarised and never followed. The request carries nothing about the member, and one line in the routine's `## Corrections` turns it off.
- **A contribution draft in every kit.** The same pass reads `improvements/CHANGELOG.md`, keeps the repairs that would be just as right on a different business, takes the member out of them, and writes `improvements/contribution-draft-YYYY-MM.md`. The brief names it once. No routine opens an issue or a pull request; the member reads the draft, then sends it or deletes it.
- **The Chief of Staff rolls it up.** Its morning brief carries one line naming which Employees on the machine have a newer kit, once per monthly check.
- `CONTRACT.md` chapter 8 in every kit gains the section that carries both rules. Both new files sit in folders classified `member`, so an upgrade never touches them.
- `docs/UPGRADING.md`, `docs/FAQ.md`, `docs/WHAT-SETS-THEM-APART.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` say the same in reader words. An Employee installed before 1.7.0 does not have the check, so this upgrade is the last one to remember by hand.
- GTM Engineer, Ad Manager, Web Dev, Social Media, Sales, Customer Satisfaction and Chief of Staff move to 1.7.0; SEO/AEO to 1.8.0. See each kit's changelog, starting with [GTM Engineer](employees/gtm-engineer/CHANGELOG.md).
- `employee.json` in every kit: the `member` file list names each Employee's own working folders, so the upgrade report counts every file that is the member's. In the SEO/AEO kit `standards/PUBLISH-STANDARD.md` moves from `member` to `kit`, so an upgrade can deliver a newer standard, written beside the member's own copy and never over it.

## Ad Manager Employee 1.6.0, and every kit bumped, 2026-09-18

The production release for the Ad Manager, written from the first install that published. An Ad Manager installed on Codex ran a real account, published three campaigns through the platform's own connection, and was audited for everything that had to be discovered one dependency at a time.

- **Ad Manager 1.6.0**: three operating modes (`advise`, `prepare`, `publish`) selected by one row in `RELEASES.md`; the build desk publishes an approved package with a receipt for every id; `recipes/META-ADS-RECIPES.md` carries the Meta dependency chain, budget semantics, publication sequence and observed recoveries; `scripts/review.mjs` is the member's review page with approvals bound to the exact revision; a rejected set leaves the queue instead of blocking the studio; budgets are typed fields with `unresolved`, `0` and authorised kept apart; measurement is five signal states; the standup writes an operating summary and shows approved, published and delivering as three facts; seven install milestones are reported separately. See [kit changelog](employees/ad-manager-employee/CHANGELOG.md).
- **Every kit**: Codex is a confirmed harness, through the app's automations, one per routine. `CAPABILITIES.md` 9.2b, new: scheduled readiness is a scheduled fire, a run by hand never counts, and a connected route gets its second confidence mark from the first scheduled read. The install prompts report scheduled execution as not yet verified until that fire happens. GTM Engineer, Web Dev, Social Media, Sales, Customer Satisfaction and Chief of Staff move to 1.6.0; SEO/AEO to 1.7.0.
- CI runs the self test inside every script under each kit's `scripts/` folder, so a new kit script is covered the day it lands.

The GTM Engineer and the Ad Manager are the two kits that have now run live launches end to end, and both carry what those runs taught. Further updates follow from every field report.

## SEO/AEO Employee 1.6.0, 2026-09-11

The SEO/AEO kit adds buyer-question mapping, sourced answer improvements and a scheduled answer visibility audit. Other kits remain at 1.5.0. See [kit changelog](employees/seo-employee/CHANGELOG.md).

## 1.5.0, 2026-09-11

The Employees read their accounts through the connections you already have, and the install is two steps.

- **`CAPABILITIES.md` section 4b in every kit, connected sources**: one row per capability an Employee reads through a connector in the harness's own directory, the vendor's own server, or its command line tool, with the read only form of each route. A connected route is preferred over the browser lane wherever both exist; the browser lane stays the fallback for every row that resolves to nothing. Routines still name capabilities and never a vendor: ten routines across the eight kits now resolve their account reads through 4b before they open a tab.
- **The install prompt** checks every 4b row in Phase 0 and names the absent ones in the handover, each with the one step the member takes in their own harness to add it. `employee.json` carries the rows under `connections`.
- **`docs/HARNESSES.md`** gains an "Adding a connection" column, `docs/PREREQUISITES.md` an optional item 11, and the Agent Employee Standard moves to v1.3: LAW 4 covers connected sources under the same rule as skills, detect, use, degrade, never install.
- Every kit is 1.5.0.

- **README**: the two step install sits directly under the intro. Extract a kit to a local folder, open your agent there and say "install the GTM Engineer from this folder". The ten other agents fold into one collapsed block, "What sets these apart" and "How an AI Employee runs" are written for a first time reader, and the mechanics (windows, period keys, capability routes, the guard script) stay in `docs/HOW-EMPLOYEES-WORK.md` and `docs/STANDARD.md` where they belong.
- **Every kit's `INSTALL-PROMPT.md`** works when the agent reads it from the folder instead of a person pasting it: the root resolves to the folder the file sits in, and a URL the agent cannot find is one question, never a stop. The `FILL THIS IN` block stays for anyone who wants to hand those over up front.
- **Every kit's README, Install section**: the same two steps, with the one copy rule, the no prompt rule and the week one notes kept as a short list under them.
- `docs/INSTALL.md` opens with the two steps and keeps the per scheduler detail.

## 1.4.0, 2026-09-05

The guardrail on outbound actions becomes the member's.

The two stops were written as law. In practice one of them was a default that people wanted to move, channel by channel, once an employee had earned it, and the only honest gate was always the harness's own permission layer. This release says so.

- **`RELEASES.md` in every kit**, classified `member` so an upgrade never touches it: one row per channel the member releases, with the action and their conditions. Shipped empty, which means every channel held exactly as before. A routine reads it in Step 0 and, on a released channel, completes the action, records it on the queue entry and in the run record, and lists it in the brief under what went out. Only the member writes it.
- **The two guardrails** replace the two stops in every contract, role file, routine, browser recipe, launcher and `AGENTS.md`. The first is held unless released; the second, credentials, has no release.
- **Agent Employee Standard v1.2**: LAW 2 rewritten the same way; every kit's `employee.json` now implements 1.2.
- README, `docs/HOW-EMPLOYEES-WORK.md`, `SECURITY.md`, the FAQ and `CONTRIBUTING.md` describe the held default and the release, not a rule.

## 1.3.0, 2026-09-04

Upgrades become possible, and the kits tell any harness what they are.

Until now `npx ai-employees hire` copied a folder and that was the whole story: no manifest, no record of what was installed, and no way back. A kit that had been running for a few weeks had usually repaired its own instructions once or twice, and there was no route for those repairs to reach a release, or for a release to reach the kit.

- **`employee.json` in every kit**: the version, the standard it implements, every routine with its schedule row, and the file classification that makes an upgrade safe. Kit files may be replaced, member files must never be touched, and `SCHEDULE.md` is owned by both sides.
- **`.installed.json`**, written at hire time: a hash per kit file, which is what lets an upgrade tell a file you edited from a file we changed.
- **`npx ai-employees upgrade`**: reports first and writes nothing without `--apply`. A kit file you edited is never overwritten; the new version lands beside it as `.new`. State, ledgers, strategy, learned browser flows and improvements are not read or written.
- **`npx ai-employees contribute`**: turns a kit's own `improvements/CHANGELOG.md`, the repairs a routine made to its own instructions, into a field report ready to open upstream.
- **`AGENTS.md`** at the repository root and in every kit, following the convention stewarded by the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation, so a harness that has never seen these kits knows to read `CONTRACT.md`, `ROLE.md` and `SCHEDULE.md` in that order. The README already said these kits are built for every harness; this is what makes that true without a person pasting anything.
- **`docs/STANDARD.md`**: the Agent Employee Standard, published for the first time.
- **`docs/UPGRADING.md`**: how the classification works and how to merge a `.new` file.
- **The product name is "AI Employees" throughout.** "Agent Employees" is retired, across 164 occurrences in 101 files. The Agent Employee Standard keeps its name, because that is the proper noun for the specification itself.

Still deferred, and said so in `docs/COST.md`: splitting each root document into a short law section read every run and a reference section read on demand, and a flag that attaches measured cost to the record a routine just wrote.

## 1.2.0, 2026-09-03

First release of the repository. The eight kits ship at 1.2.0, the cold install release: a prerequisites section in every README, `scripts/guard.mjs` in front of every routine, Windows launcher examples that fail loudly on a missing login, a login check in Phase 0 of every install prompt, scheduler accurate sleep and catch up text, a ten minute jitter tolerance on the drift check, a `.gitignore` in every kit, `metadata: internal: true` on every routine, brand neutral self test fixtures, and one pointer line home.

Kit changelogs: [GTM Engineer](employees/gtm-engineer/CHANGELOG.md), [SEO/AEO Employee](employees/seo-employee/CHANGELOG.md), [Web Dev Employee](employees/web-dev-employee/CHANGELOG.md), [Social Media Employee](employees/social-media-employee/CHANGELOG.md), [Ad Manager Employee](employees/ad-manager-employee/CHANGELOG.md), [Sales Employee](employees/sales-employee/CHANGELOG.md), [Customer Satisfaction Employee](employees/customer-satisfaction-employee/CHANGELOG.md), [Chief of Staff](employees/chief-of-staff/CHANGELOG.md).

Also in this release: the root documents (README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, TRADEMARKS, SECURITY), the docs folder, the `hire` skill, the `npx ai-employees hire` installer, fictional examples per kit, and the no-dashes workflow.

Deferred to 1.3.0, and said so in `docs/COST.md`: splitting each root document into a short law section read every run and a reference section read on demand, and a flag that attaches measured cost to the record a routine just wrote.
