/**
 * Starter jobs (design handoff "Template chips" and Settings > Plugins).
 * One list, in starters.json, serves both: a chip puts a starter's job in
 * the composer, and "Hire now" (on the chip, or a Plugins card) hires the
 * starter as it stands, its skills into the library first.
 *
 * Each starter names the apps its job needs; the job text names them too,
 * since it is all the setup model reads. The skills are built-ins from the
 * employee folder. `hire` is the starter's own setup, the one "Hire now"
 * sends (genui/hirePayload.ts starterHirePayload): a few names to pick an
 * unused one from, the role, a one-line description, the routine, what
 * starts the work and the app they answer through. It always asks first.
 * server/tests/test_home_catalog_contract.py checks all of it, and that
 * each starter builds that way without losing an app.
