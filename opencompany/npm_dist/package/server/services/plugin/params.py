"""Parameter coercion helpers shared by plugins.

The parameter panel stores ``""`` for any field the user has cleared or never
filled, **whatever the declared type**. Against a ``str`` field that is
harmless; against ``Optional[float]``, ``bool`` or ``Dict[str, Any]`` it is a
hard validation error, and a freshly-dropped node then fails on its own
defaults with something like *"Input should be a valid dictionary"*.

Lives here rather than in a plugin folder because it is a property of the
panel-to-Pydantic boundary, not of any vendor. Two plugins needed it before it
was worth extracting; the per-node precedents that predate it are
``AndroidServiceParams._coerce_parameters`` and
``WriteTodosParams._coerce_todos``.
