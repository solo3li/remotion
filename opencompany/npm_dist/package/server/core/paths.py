"""Central path resolution for OpenCompany's on-disk state.

Single source of truth for every directory the app reads or writes.
The default root lives at ``~/.opencompany/`` — the user's home directory,
cross-platform via :meth:`pathlib.Path.home` (``$HOME`` on POSIX,
``%USERPROFILE%`` on Windows). Override with ``DATA_DIR`` env var.

Why home-rooted (not project-local): claude's auth, the WhatsApp
session DB, the credentials store, and per-workflow workspaces all
survive ``rm -rf`` of the repo. Multiple OpenCompany checkouts on the
same machine share state instead of each carrying its own copy. The
``~/.opencompany/`` convention matches Stripe's ``~/.config/stripe/``,
ngrok's ``~/.ngrok2/``, and claude code's own ``~/.claude/``.

Generic subtree layout under ``<DATA_DIR>/`` (= ``~/.opencompany/`` by
default). The module exports only generic helpers — plugin-specific
subpaths (``<DATA_DIR>/claude/``, ``<DATA_DIR>/packages/stripe/bin/``,
etc.) are composed at the plugin's call site, NOT hardcoded here.
That keeps this module from growing one helper per package:

  - :func:`data_path`      ``<DATA_DIR>/<subpath>`` — universal state-path
                            primitive every plugin composes against
  - :func:`packages_dir`   ``<DATA_DIR>/packages/`` — downloaded-binary root
  - :func:`package_dir`    ``<DATA_DIR>/packages/<name>/`` — per-service install
                            slot (callers compose further, e.g.
                            ``package_dir("claude") / "npm"``)
  - :func:`daemons_dir`    ``<DATA_DIR>/daemons/`` — supervised daemon cwds
  - :func:`workspaces_dir` ``<DATA_DIR>/workspaces/`` — per-workflow scratch
  - :func:`workspace_dir`  ``<DATA_DIR>/workspaces/<workflow_id>/``
  - :func:`example_workflows_dir` git-tracked seed JSONs at
                            ``<repo>/.opencompany/workflows/`` (NOT under DATA_DIR)

Reference layout once typical plugins compose against the helpers
above (Wave 14):

  - ``<DATA_DIR>/claude/``           Claude Code auth state (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR)
  - ``<DATA_DIR>/packages/``         Single shared OpenCompany install
    root. Holds one ``package.json`` + ``bun.lock`` + ``node_modules/``
    covering every OpenCompany-managed npm-registry package
    (``@anthropic-ai/claude-code``, ``edgymeow``, ``agent-browser``,
    ``cf``, ``vercel``). Each plugin's ``_install.py`` calls
    ``core.js_runtime.add_package`` (``bun add --cwd <packages_dir>``)
    to extend the tree idempotently — bun manages the dep graph and
    runs the bin shims on its own runtime; no Node or npm.
  - ``<DATA_DIR>/packages/stripe/``    Stripe CLI binary (non-npm)
  - ``<DATA_DIR>/packages/temporal/``  Temporal CLI binary (non-npm,
                                        pooch-managed)
  - ``<DATA_DIR>/workspaces/<slug>/`` per-workflow scratch
  - ``<DATA_DIR>/daemons/``           supervised daemon cwds (shared root)
  - ``<DATA_DIR>/whatsapp/``          persistent WhatsApp session DB
  - ``<DATA_DIR>/credentials.db``     Fernet-encrypted secrets
  - ``<DATA_DIR>/workflow.db``        SQLite app DB
  - ``<DATA_DIR>/temporal.db``        Temporal server SQLite

Legacy MachinaOS builds split binaries under
:func:`platformdirs.user_cache_path` (``~/.cache/MachinaOs/`` etc.)
and Temporal under its own ``pooch.os_cache("machinaos-temporal")``
namespace — operators reported both as "not local". Daemon cwds
also used to live under ``workspaces/_<namespace>/`` and polluted
per-workflow scratch with framework state. Consolidating everything
under ``<DATA_DIR>/`` means a single ``mv ~/.opencompany /backup``
carries the entire OpenCompany footprint.

Out of scope: globally-installed binaries (Himalaya — system
package manager) and the dev workspace's own `package.json` deps
(none of the runtime packages remain there after the WhatsApp
migration).

Shipped example workflows live at ``<repo>/.opencompany/workflows/`` —
git-tracked seed JSONs auto-imported on first launch by
``services.example_loader``. During migration, the legacy
``<repo>/.machina/workflows/`` directory is used only when the canonical
directory is absent. The location is independent of ``DATA_DIR``.

Importable as ``from core.paths import data_path, package_dir,
workspace_dir, …`` so consumers never have to recompute the root
themselves (the old ``Path(__file__).resolve().parents[N] / "data"
/ ...`` idiom was duplicated across 4+ files and brittle to file
moves).

DATA_DIR resolution rules (see :func:`opencompany_root`):

  - Starts with ``~`` → ``Path.expanduser()`` (user home).
  - Absolute path → used verbatim.
  - Relative path → resolved under the repo root (back-compat for
    callers who set ``DATA_DIR=data`` to keep the pre-cutover layout).

Migration of pre-cutover ``<repo>/data/`` trees is the operator's
responsibility — set ``DATA_DIR`` to the legacy path (e.g.
``DATA_DIR=data``) to keep using the old layout, or move the
contents manually:

  mv server/data/claude-machina  ~/.opencompany/claude
  mv server/data/workspaces      ~/.opencompany/workspaces
  mv server/data/workflow.db     ~/.opencompany/workflow.db
  mv server/data/credentials.db  ~/.opencompany/credentials.db
