"""Plugins for the 'android' palette group.

Self-contained plugin folder (Wave 11.H pattern) — owns its
WebSocket handlers (`_handlers.py`), HTTP router (`_router.py`),
action-dispatch service (`_dispatcher.py`), and the relay-pairing
sub-package (`_relay/`). The 16 service plugins (battery_monitor,
wifi_automation, ...) live alongside as siblings.

Wiring is body-free; both registrations are idempotent.
