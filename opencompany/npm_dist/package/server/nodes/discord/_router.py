"""HTTP surface: the interactions endpoint and the OAuth2 callback.

A plugin-owned router rather than a ``WebhookSource``, for three reasons the
generic intake cannot express:

* Discord's endpoint-validation probe deliberately sends bad signatures and
  requires **401**. ``WebhookSource.handle`` raises 400 on verifier failure,
  and a 400 makes Discord refuse to save the endpoint URL at all.
* The initial response is due within three seconds. ``WebhookSource.handle``
  awaits shaping, ``emit`` (a Temporal Visibility query plus a Signal per
  consumer) and dispatch before the router writes a byte. That is not a
  latency budget a plugin controls. This ACKs first and fans out after.
* The reply body is part of the protocol -- PING must be answered with
  ``{"type": 1}`` -- while the generic route returns a fixed envelope.

Interaction delivery is mutually exclusive with the gateway: setting an
endpoint URL stops INTERACTION_CREATE arriving over the socket. The account's
public key is what identifies which app is calling, so each app points at its
own path rather than the server trial-verifying against every stored key,
which would be both a timing oracle and an availability multiplier.
