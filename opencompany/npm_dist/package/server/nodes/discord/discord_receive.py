"""discordReceive — fire a workflow on an inbound Discord message.

Attachments arrive as metadata only. Downloading here would put the payload
into the trigger's result, which is persisted, broadcast and replayed into LLM
context -- and on a deployed workflow this node body never runs at all, since
the engine marks the trigger pre-executed and passes its output through
verbatim. Wire discordAction[download_attachments] downstream to fetch them.
