"""CloudEvents factories and the dispatch wrapper for the Cloud API plugin.

Two things here are load-bearing and easy to get wrong.

**The base class does not reach deployed listeners.** ``WebhookSource.handle``
only calls ``event_waiter.dispatch``, which serves the canvas Run path.
Deployed triggers are Temporal ``TriggerListenerWorkflow`` executions reached
by ``services.events.dispatch.emit``. A source that does not call ``emit``
works perfectly when you press Run and does nothing at all once deployed.

**The type strings must match the canary registration exactly.** ``emit``
runs a Visibility query for ``EventType='<type>'``, and the listener carries
whatever ``register_canary_trigger_type`` recorded. A mismatch is silent: the
listener sits Running forever and no signal ever arrives.

Message and status events carry distinct types on purpose. Per-node filters
are not applied on the deployed push path, so the CloudEvents type is the
only discriminator that actually works there.
