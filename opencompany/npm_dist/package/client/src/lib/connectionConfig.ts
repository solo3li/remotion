/**
 * Centralised tuning constants for the auth + WebSocket connection layer.
 *
 * The hand-rolled retry chain in `AuthContext` and the flat 3-second
 * reconnect timer in `WebSocketContext` were retired in favour of
 * library-backed retry policies (TanStack Query for auth, PartySocket
 * for the WS). The numeric envelope of those policies lives here so a
 * future tuning pass — tighter backoff, longer cap, smaller queue — is
 * a single-file edit and tests can reference the same values.
 *
 * Pattern mirrors `client/src/lib/queryConfig.ts`'s `STALE_TIME` /
 * `GC_TIME` buckets: named, frozen, JSDoc-explained.
 *
 * Pre-existing constants (REQUEST_TIMEOUT, ping interval) stay in
 * `WebSocketContext.tsx` for now — moving them is out of scope for
 * this change.

 *
 * Formula:
 *
 *     sleep = random_between(0, min(CAP_MS, BASE_MS * 2^attempt))
 *
 * Sample sequence (BASE_MS=50, CAP_MS=4000):
 *
 *     attempt 0 → up to 50ms
 *     attempt 1 → up to 100ms
 *     attempt 2 → up to 200ms
 *     attempt 3 → up to 400ms

 *     attempt 5 → up to 1600ms
 *     attempt 6 → up to 3200ms
 *     attempt 7 → up to 4000ms (capped)
 *
 * Total upper-bound wall time ≈ 10 s across 7 retries — covers the
 * typical ~4 s backend cold-start window in 4-5 attempts. The previous
 * `1000ms · Math.pow(2, n)` chain needed 31 s in the worst case.
