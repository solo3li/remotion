## Adopted

Open Council Three became the logo on 2026-09-30. The app redraws it as vector paths in
[client/src/components/brand/geometry.ts](../../../client/src/components/brand/geometry.ts):
the mark measured from [open-council-three.png](./open-council-three.png) and made exactly
three-fold symmetric, and the wordmark set in Newsreader (SIL Open Font License 1.1) and
converted to outlines. Both are one colour, the text colour: black on light themes, white on
dark. The favicon and the desktop icon embed the same mark path; the Home orb is its 3D
version. This PNG stays here as the reference.
