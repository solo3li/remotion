"""Settings > Skills and Settings > Plugins read server content from the
client, so the two are held to each other here, reading the client files
off disk:

- the Discover folder the client names (``DISCOVER_SKILL_FOLDER`` in
  client/src/features/home/data/skills.ts) exists, is not disabled, and
  holds skills an AI employee can use as they are: owner-facing
  ``metadata.title`` and ``metadata.summary``, no tools to connect, no
  reserved name (``skill`` is the Skill tool's own entry, a
  ``*-personality`` skill replaces the whole system message), and a name no
  other folder uses;
- every starter bundle (client/src/features/home/hire/starters.json) uses
  only those skills, names apps the hire's app registry resolves, says so in
  its job (the job text is all the setup model reads), and fits the hire's
  job limit;
- every starter's own setup (its ``hire`` block, which "Hire now" sends as
  it stands through the client's ``starterHirePayload``) is read by the hire
  exactly as written, and builds with "ask me first" on without losing an
  app it names or the way it says it starts.
