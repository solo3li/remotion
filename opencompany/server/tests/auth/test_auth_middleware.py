"""Tests for AuthMiddleware, including an invariant that pins its riskiest rule.

The middleware gates by exclusion: any GET/HEAD outside `/api/` and `/ws/` is
served without authentication, because the SPA shell must load before login.
That is correct today only because every router in the app is mounted under
`/api/` (or is already deliberately public). Nothing enforced that, so a future
router mounted at, say, `/admin/` would become world-readable with no code
review signal. `TestPublicSurfaceInvariant` is that signal.

    Two traps here, both of which made every gating assertion pass vacuously

      1. It must use dependency_injector's `override()` API. A plain
         `monkeypatch.setattr` on the container does not take.
      2. It must override the container object `middleware.auth` itself
