"""Worker self-restart in TemporalWorkerManager / TemporalWorkerPool.

The Temporal worker shuts down on a transient poll failure rather than
auto-retrying, and the run task is detached (main.py's startup retry loop
has already returned). The SDK ``Worker`` is single-use — a second
``run()`` on the same instance raises ``RuntimeError("Already started")``
— so every restart attempt must REBUILD a fresh worker. The previous
restart loop re-ran the same instance, which meant one crash left the
task queue permanently unpolled while the loop logged "restarting"
forever; the previous version of this test masked that by mocking a
re-runnable worker.

Cancellation (from ``stop()``) always wins so shutdown is never delayed
by a restart. Backoff knobs come from Settings (env-driven); the conftest
stubs Settings, so we patch it to a SimpleNamespace with tiny real
backoffs.
