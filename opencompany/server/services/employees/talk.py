"""Talk: the line the owner talks to an employee through.

Every employee can be talked to on its Home page. In the graph that is

    chatTrigger -> agent -> chatReply ("Reply in Chat")

The owner's message (chat session = the workflow id) starts a run of that
trigger's subgraph only: a run keeps the firing trigger's downstream nodes
plus their tools and config, so the line runs on the owner's messages alone
and never disturbs the work path.

``talk_state`` reads a graph:

- ``on``: a chat trigger feeds an agent that answers through Reply in Chat;
- ``off``: one step adds it. Either a chat trigger feeds an agent that has
  no reply yet (any agent: a chat hire's worker is its own talk agent), or
  the graph has no chat trigger and an agent a talk agent can copy
  (aiAgent / chatAgent, whose parameters are the plain prompt, model and
  instructions);
- ``unsupported``: neither. A chat trigger that feeds no agent counts here:
  a second one would start two runs for every message.

``plan_talk_line`` turns ``off`` into ``GraphAdditions``:

- a reply only: "Reply in Chat" after the chat-fed agent;
- or a whole line beside the worker: a "Talk" chat trigger on the
  workflow's session, a "Talk with <name>" agent on the worker's model, its
  own Context (a conversation is never shared), the worker's tools and
  skills wired to it too (the same nodes, so Memory, the checklist and the
  canvas are shared), and its reply.

A hired employee also gets what the Hire builder gives: the Agent Builder
tool on its talk agent (never on a worker that strangers write to), and,
for a schedule worker, "Post to Talk", which puts its reports in the
thread. Replies and reports go out only when the agent had something to
say (``send_condition``: not NO_REPLY).

Pure: no I/O, never imports ``nodes/``; built on services/graph_build.py,
so the Hire builder, Turn on Talk and the Agent Builder number, label and
wire nodes the same way.
