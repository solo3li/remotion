"""What a hired employee may be given: one rule for the Hire builder and for
anything added later (the Agent Builder, when the owner asks from Talk).

A tool is a node type from the app registry (config/employee_apps.json)
or one of the tools every hire gets (``BASE_TOOLS``). ``check_tool``
decides, in this order:

1. is it one of those at all;
2. the "ask me first" ground rule: nothing that can send or spend
   (``allowed_when_asking_first``), unless the app declares
   ``ask_first_params`` that make it safe, in which case it is given in
   that form (the browser reads, and hands any change to the owner);
3. the Hire allowlist (``node_allowlist.is_hire_allowed``);
4. its app is connected, when the caller says what is connected (the Hire
   builder does not: a hire may name an app it will connect later, and
   its card says what to connect).

``check_skill`` refuses the names no hired employee can have: ``skill``
(the Skill tool's own entry) and ``*-personality`` skills, which replace
the whole system message and with it the rules prompt.py writes.

A refusal carries a code for callers and a reason in plain words an agent
can pass on to the owner. Never imports ``nodes/``.
