"""Bound what one tool result may add to an agent's LLM conversation.

Both agent loops, the in-process ``run_native_agent_loop``
(``services/agent_runtime.py``) and the Temporal ``AgentWorkflow``, append a
tool's serialized result to the conversation, and every later model turn
re-sends it. An external tool can return far more text than a model needs: a
single TikHub call returned about 400,000 characters, and a handful of those
pushed the ``agent.execute_llm_step`` input past Temporal's payload warning
and the saved conversation past the 1 MB seed cap that ``agent.prepare_payload``
enforces (docs-internal/errors.md, entry 28).

:func:`bound_tool_output` keeps the first ``limit`` characters of the copy the
model sees and appends a note saying so. The tool's own result is never
touched; the cut happens where the loop turns that result into a message.

Stdlib and ``constants`` only, so workflow code can import it freely
(importing anything under ``services/llm`` runs that package's ``__init__``,
which reads ``llm_defaults.json``).

Agent-internal channels are exempt (:func:`tool_output_is_capped`): a
delegated agent's answer, a skill load, and Task Manager results. Each is
bounded by other means, and cutting one would hand the model a broken brief.
