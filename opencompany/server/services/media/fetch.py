"""Download a remote file straight into a workflow workspace.

Separate module rather than part of :mod:`services.media.workspace` because
that one is synchronous by contract (see its ``workspace_root`` docstring --
it must never do the database read the id->slug translation would need) and
this is unavoidably async.

The alternative every caller reaches for otherwise is ``httpx.get`` followed
by ``open(path, "wb").write(...)``, which is what ``fileDownloader`` does:
no containment, a filename taken from the remote URL, a non-atomic write and
no size cap. This exists so that is never the easy option.
