"""CloudEvents factory and the dispatch wrapper for Stripe webhook deliveries.

Two things here are load-bearing.

**Every Stripe event travels under one CloudEvents type.** A deployed trigger
listens for exactly one type: ``register_canary_trigger_type`` records one
string per node type, and both the listener's ``EventType`` Search Attribute
and the workflow controller's ``on_event`` match it exactly. Envelopes typed
per Stripe event (``stripe.charge.succeeded`` and so on) could never reach a
deployed ``stripeReceive``. The Stripe type rides in ``subject`` and in
``data["event_type"]``, which is where the node's filter reads it.

**``WebhookSource.handle`` does not reach deployed listeners.** It feeds the
in-process event waiter, which serves a canvas Run and the Temporal-off
deploy path. Deployed triggers on Temporal are reached only by
``services.events.dispatch.emit``, hence :func:`emit_stripe_event`.
