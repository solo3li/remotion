"""Context descriptor construction.

The ``context`` node is a declarative opt-in surface onto an agent's
conversation scope — it never owns the conversation itself (that lives in
the plain conversation store, keyed by workflow/generation/agent node).
What it *does* own is the shape of the descriptor handed to the agent
runtime.

That shape lives here rather than in ``services/plugin/edge_walker.py`` so
the framework carries no knowledge of this plugin's parameters or its
thread-selection rules. Registered from the package ``__init__`` via
``services.plugin.edge_walker.register_agent_context_builder``.
