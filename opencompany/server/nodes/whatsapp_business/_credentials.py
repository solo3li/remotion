"""Credential for Meta's official WhatsApp Business Platform Cloud API.

Distinct from the ``whatsapp`` credential in ``nodes/whatsapp/``, which pairs
a *personal* account over an unofficial Go bridge. Same product name, wholly
different auth model, so they are separate ids and separate catalogue entries.

The brand icon must live beside this file as ``whatsapp_business.svg`` --
``Credential.get_icon_path`` resolves ``<cls.id>.svg`` co-located with the
class, and nothing else is consulted.
