# Outlook Mail Receive (`msMailReceive`)

| **Category** | microsoft / trigger (class `group = ("microsoft", "trigger")`) |
| **Backend handler** | [`server/nodes/microsoft/mail_receive/__init__.py`](../../../server/nodes/microsoft/mail_receive/__init__.py) (`MailReceiveNode`, on `PollingTriggerNode`); ctx-free Graph helpers in [`_base.py`](../../../server/nodes/microsoft/_base.py) (`graph_get_raw`, `mark_message_read_raw`); base loop in [`services/plugin/polling.py`](../../../server/services/plugin/polling.py); canary registration in [`nodes/microsoft/__init__.py`](../../../server/nodes/microsoft/__init__.py) |

| **Skill (if any)** | none |
| **Dual-purpose tool** | no (trigger) |

## Purpose

Fire when a new message appears in an Outlook mail folder. Microsoft Graph
has no push channel here, so the node polls `mailFolders/{folder}/messages`
on an interval, diffs the visible ids against the previous cycle, fetches
each new message and emits its summary. Three execution paths share the same
four hooks: the Temporal `PollingTriggerWorkflow` (deployed, canary type
`com.opencompany.msmail.message.received`), the legacy asyncio collector, and
an inline `execute()` override for the canvas Run button.

## Inputs (handles)

None - this is a trigger; it is the head of a run.

## Parameters

`MailReceiveParams`, `extra="ignore"`. No `displayOptions` on any field.

| Name | Type | Default | Required | displayOptions.show | Description |
|------|------|---------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| `mailbox` | string | `""` | no | - | Shared mailbox address to watch; empty = `/me` |
| `only_unread` | bool | `true` | no | - | Adds `$filter=isRead eq false` |
| `from_filter` | string | `""` | no | - | Adds `from/emailAddress/address eq '<addr>'` (single quotes doubled) |
| `folder` | string | `inbox` | no | - | Well-known folder name or folder id, used in `mailFolders/{folder}/messages` |
| `mark_as_read` | bool | `false` | no | - | PATCH `isRead: true` after emitting |
| `poll_interval` | int (10..3600) | `60` | no | - | Seconds between cycles; clamped by `poll_interval_clamp` |

## Outputs (handles)

| Handle | Shape | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `output-main` | object | The summary dict from `_summarize` (plus `id` on the deployed paths) |

### Output payload (TypeScript shape)

The declared `MailReceiveOutput` model names the sender field `from_`, but
every path emits the raw `_summarize` dict without passing through
`_serialize_result` (the canvas path returns the dict from the `execute`
override; the deployed paths hand `fetch_detail`'s dict straight to the
queue / activity result). The wire key is therefore `from`:

```ts
{
  message_id: string;
  id?: string;                 // deployed paths only: stable dedup key (= message_id)
  conversation_id: string | null;
  from: string;                // sender address ("" when absent)
  from_name: string;
  to: string[];
  subject: string;
  body_preview: string;
  body: string;                // full body content
  received: string | null;     // receivedDateTime
  is_read: boolean | null;
  has_attachments: boolean | null;
  web_link: string | null;
}
```

```

## Decision Logic

- **Query construction** (`_query`): `$select` =
  `id,subject,from,toRecipients,receivedDateTime,bodyPreview,body,isRead,
  hasAttachments,webLink,conversationId`, `$top = 25`. With `only_unread`
  and / or `from_filter` a `$filter` is sent and `$orderby` is dropped
  (Graph returns `InefficientFilter` for filter + orderby on different
  properties without the advanced-query header); with no filter,
  `$orderby=receivedDateTime desc`. Because the trigger dedups by id it does
  not depend on ordering.
- **Dedup / window**: `seen_ids` is rebased to the provider's current window
  every cycle (both the activity and the coroutine), so a message that
  leaves the 25-item window and re-enters it later fires again. On the
  baseline pass nothing is emitted.
- **Temporal activity** (`as_poll_activity`): `setup_service` failure
  re-raises (Temporal retry policy owns it); a `fetch_detail` failure skips
  that id with a warning; `post_emit` failures are swallowed; the result is
  `{"events": [...], "seen_ids": list(current)}`.
- **Legacy coroutine** (`_build_poll_coroutine`): setup failure ends the
  poller; baseline failure logs a warning and treats everything as new on the
  next cycle; per-cycle exceptions are logged and retried next interval.
- **Canvas Run** (`execute` override): registers no `event_waiter`; instead
  it polls inline until the first cycle with new ids, then returns ONE
  message - `next(iter(new_ids))`, an arbitrary member of the set (the
  variable is named `newest_id` but set iteration is unordered). The
  remaining new ids are folded into `seen` and never emitted on that run.
  Cancellation returns `{success: False, error: "Cancelled by user"}`; any
  other exception outside the cycle returns `{success: False, error}`.
- **Auth**: `graph_get_raw` / `mark_message_read_raw` call
  `ensure_fresh_microsoft_token("owner")` (default user) and issue plain
  `httpx` requests with a 30 s timeout; no stored tokens ->
  `PermissionError(provider="microsoft", reason="missing", auth="oauth2")`.
- **`_clamp_interval`**: non-numeric -> `default_poll_interval` (60);
  result clamped to 10..3600.

## Side Effects

- **Database writes**: canvas Run records one `api_usage_metrics` row
  (`service="microsoft_graph"`, action `read`, cost 0.0) when a message
  fires; the deployed paths record none. Token refresh persists new tokens
  via `auth_service.store_oauth_tokens`.
- **Broadcasts**: canvas Run sends `update_node_status(node_id, "waiting",
  {"message": "Waiting for Outlook mail (polling every Ns)...",
  "event_type": "ms_mail_received"}, workflow_id=...)`. Deployed status
  broadcasts come from the trigger manager / `PollingTriggerWorkflow`.
- **External API calls**: `GET {base}/mailFolders/{folder}/messages`,
  `GET {base}/messages/{id}`, `PATCH {base}/messages/{id}` (`isRead: true`)
  on `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0` with `Authorization: Bearer`.
- **Mutation**: `mark_as_read` flips `isRead` on the source mailbox (the
  only write; best-effort, failure logged at WARNING).

## External Dependencies

- **Credentials**: `MicrosoftCredential` (`id = "microsoft"`, OAuth2,
  `Mail.ReadWrite` / `Mail.ReadWrite.Shared` scopes; `microsoft_client_id`
  and `microsoft_client_secret` api-key rows for refresh). Shared-mailbox
  polling needs Full Access on that mailbox.
- **Services**: Microsoft Graph v1.0; Temporal when deployed
  (`TaskQueue.TRIGGERS_POLL`; `register_canary_trigger_type("msMailReceive",
  "com.opencompany.msmail.message.received")` opts it into
  `PollingTriggerWorkflow`).
- **Python packages**: `httpx`, `pydantic`, `temporalio` (activity
  decorator on the deployed path).
- **Environment variables**: none read directly.

## Edge cases & known limits

- `$top` is fixed at 25: with `only_unread=true` (default) the window is
  the 25 most relevant unread messages in Graph's order; a burst of more
  than 25 new messages between cycles emits only the ones inside the window.
- Output key is `from`, not the `from_` declared on `MailReceiveOutput` -
  the model documents the shape but is not enforced on any path (contrast
  [`msMail`](./msMail.md), whose `read` op emits `from_`).
- `mark_as_read=true` combined with `only_unread=true` removes fired
  messages from the next window, which is the stable configuration; with
  `only_unread=false` and no `from_filter`, the window is the 25 newest
  messages and old ids churn out as mail arrives.
- The trigger never downloads attachments; it carries `has_attachments`
  and `message_id` so a downstream [`msMail`](./msMail.md)
  `download_attachments` can fetch them.
- Canvas Run returns one message per run and swallows the rest of that
  cycle's new ids.
- `event_type = "ms_mail_received"` is the legacy event-waiter key; the
  canvas path does not use the event waiter at all.
