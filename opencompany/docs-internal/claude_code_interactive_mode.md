# Claude Code interactive mode (subprocess + stream-json)

> **TL;DR.** `ClaudeSessionPool` keeps a warm `claude` subprocess per
> session key (the RFC-0002 conversation key `context_bridge.pool_key` when
> a Context node is wired; the legacy `simpleMemory.node_id` on `input-memory`
> graphs — `bound_key` in `AICliService.run_batch`) and drives it with the same flags Anthropic's
> own VSCode extension uses — stdio pipes, `--output-format stream-json
> --input-format stream-json --verbose --ide`. Multi-turn happens by
> writing newline-delimited JSON to `proc.stdin` of the long-lived

> longer the runtime contract — claude writes it for `--resume`
> persistence but the `result` event is stdout-only in
> stream-json mode.

## Why we cut over from `-p`

Pre-cutover OpenCompany spawned `claude -p --output-format stream-json`
and parsed NDJSON events on stdout. Two reasons to leave `-p`:

1. **Anthropic billing change (2026-06-15).** Per
   [`code.claude.com/docs/en/headless`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless),
   subscription plans bill `claude -p` and Agent-SDK usage from a
   separate "monthly Agent SDK credit." The expectation was that the
   interactive entrypoint (`claude-vscode`, not `sdk-cli`) stays on the
   subscription's interactive bucket once `-p` is dropped. **This is
   unverified:** nothing in OpenCompany checks which entrypoint or
   billing bucket the CLI reports for these spawns.
2. **Match how Anthropic itself drives `claude` programmatically.** The
   VSCode extension (`$VSCODE_EXT_DIR/anthropic.claude-code-2.1.140-<platform>/extension.js`,
   line 156)
   spawns claude with exactly four flags (`--output-format stream-json
   --input-format stream-json --verbose --ide`) and never emits `-p`.
   That's the wire we reuse.

## Architecture

One transport (`asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` with `stdin/stdout/stderr=PIPE`),
one protocol (line-delimited stream-json events on stdout). No PTY.
A background `stdout_reader_task` parses each line and dispatches via
`_handle_stream_event`.

| Layer | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Transport** | `asyncio.subprocess.Process` with stdio pipes — same on POSIX + Windows |
| **Send turn** | `proc.stdin.write(json.dumps({"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":...}}) + "\n")` |
| **Read events** | `proc.stdout.readline()` loop → `json.loads(line)` → `_handle_stream_event` |
| **Completion detect** | stream-json event where `type == "result"` (set via `provider.is_final_event`); stdout EOF also wakes the turn, which then fails with the child's exit code |
| **Context reset (`/clear` equivalent)** | kill subprocess + drop captured UUID — stream-json input has no slash-command path (confirmed in VSCode extension source). Primitive: `pool.clear` (no production caller today); Context-bound sessions are reset by `terminate_conversations` and the generation fence in `acquire` |
| **Crash recovery** | `acquire()` checks `process.returncode`; respawns with `--resume <captured_uuid>` so the same on-disk JSONL keeps growing. Only while the dead entry is still in the pool — an idle reap or LRU eviction removes the entry and its UUID |

### Code layout

Per the canonical plugin-folder pattern, every claude-specific
module lives under `server/nodes/agent/claude_code_agent/`. The
generic framework under `server/services/cli_agent/` owns only
the shared dispatcher + per-provider registries that the plugin
self-registers into on import.

## argv shape

Built by [`AnthropicClaudeProvider.interactive_argv`](../server/nodes/agent/claude_code_agent/_provider.py).
Stable head, task-driven tail:

```
claude
  --output-format stream-json
  --input-format stream-json
  --verbose
  --ide
  [--mcp-config <json> --strict-mcp-config]
  --model <name>
  [--resume <UUID> | --continue | --session-id <UUID>]
  --allowedTools <csv>
  --permission-mode dontAsk
  [--append-system-prompt <text>]
  [--effort low|medium|high]
  [--add-dir <path>]...
  [--disallowedTools <csv>]
  [--agent <name>]
```

Notable absences (intentional):

| Flag | Reason omitted |
|---|---|
| `-p` / `--print` | Drops us into the SDK billing bucket; the whole point of the cutover. |
| Positional prompt (`-- "<text>"`) | Prompt arrives via stdin in stream-json input mode; an argv positional would double-send the first turn. `interactive_argv`'s `include_prompt` parameter is kept for back-compat but ignored. |
| `--continue` | Not set by the node's own continuity logic. The CLI reference says it skips sessions created non-interactively (`-p` / stream-json input), which is exactly what the pool spawns, so it never found the prior conversation. Memory-bound runs pass `--resume <last_session_id>` instead (the UUID persisted on the memory node by `_persist_memory`). It is still emitted when a task in the node's `tasks` list sets `continue_session: true`, because `ClaudeTaskSpec` keeps the field. |
| `--include-partial-messages`, `--include-hook-events`, `--max-turns`, `--max-budget-usd`, `--fallback-model` | All `-p`-only. `ClaudeTaskSpec` keeps the fields for back-compat; they're silently dropped here. External cost / turn caps are a Phase 2 follow-up. |

Emitted for session identity:

| Flag | When |
|---|---|
| `--session-id <UUID>` | Cold spawn with no continuity flag. `ClaudeSessionPool._spawn` mints a `uuid4` so `current_session_uuid` is known before the first stream event; crash-recovery respawns then always have a UUID to `--resume`. The CLI requires a valid UUID and rejects one already in use. |
| `--resume <UUID>` | Crash-recovery respawn of a pooled session, and every memory-bound run that has a persisted `last_session_id`. Works from any directory on the pinned CLI (2.1.223+). |

`--permission-mode dontAsk` is the documented mode for *"only
pre-approved tools, no prompts"* per
[`code.claude.com/docs/en/permission-modes`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permission-modes):
a call that would otherwise prompt is denied instead (non-interactive
automation has no human at the keyboard to click "Allow"). Only calls
matching `--allowedTools` run, plus read-only Bash commands, which the
same doc says run without a rule. `--allowedTools` pre-approves; it
does not remove Claude's other built-ins from the model's context
(`--tools` / `--disallowedTools` do that, and neither is emitted by
default), so the model can still call `Read`, `Bash` and the rest and
receive a denial. The earlier `bypassPermissions` default *"skips the
permission layer entirely"* (same doc, §"Skip all checks"), which
turned `--allowedTools` / `--disallowedTools` into documentation-only
fields and let claude's built-in `Read` / `Edit` / `Bash` /
`Glob` / `Grep` / `Write` / `Skill` / `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` fire
regardless of wiring. `acceptEdits` was the prior config default but
would prompt for any non-Edit tool — hanging the headless agent.
`dontAsk` is the mode that combines no prompts with denial of
everything not pre-approved.

## Session pool — warm-process reuse

[`ClaudeSessionPool`](../server/nodes/agent/claude_code_agent/_pool.py) is
keyed by the RFC-0002 conversation key `context_bridge.pool_key`
(`(workflow_id, agent_node_id, generation)`), falling back to the legacy
`simpleMemory.node_id` only on `input-memory` graphs (`bound_key` in
`AICliService.run_batch`). Each entry is a
`PooledClaudeSession` carrying the live `asyncio.subprocess.Process`,
the session UUID (set at spawn from the `--session-id` the pool mints
or the `--resume` UUID; filled in from the first event that has one
only when neither flag was passed, i.e. a task forced `--continue`),
the MCP bearer token embedded in the spawn argv, a `turn_lease` and a
narrower `lock` (both `asyncio.Lock`), an `asyncio.Event` signalled by
the stdout reader on `result`, and a per-turn event buffer.

| Operation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `acquire(memory_node_id, ...)` | For a Context key `(workflow_id, agent_node_id, generation)`, first terminates any entry for the same workflow and agent with a different generation (reason `generation_changed`), so a Reset's generation bump fences the old process. Then: live + healthy entry → wait for its `turn_lease`, re-check it is still the pooled entry, and warm-reuse it (`_prepare_warm_reuse` rebinds the MCP `BatchContext` and applies the skill diff). Live + dead entry → drop, capture its UUID, spawn fresh with `--resume <UUID>` so the same JSONL keeps growing. No entry → cold spawn. At cap → LRU evict (skipping entries whose `lock` or `turn_lease` is held). Returns with the `turn_lease` held. |
| `send_turn(session, prompt, ...)` | Holds `session.lock`. Clears `result_event` + `events_this_turn`. Writes one stream-json line to `proc.stdin`, awaits `result_event` (timeout = 600s default). Returns a `SessionResult` built from the per-turn event buffer. Persists `result.session_id` onto `session.current_session_uuid`. |
| `clear(session, ...)` | Kill the subprocess, drop the captured UUID. Next `acquire` spawns fresh with a newly minted `--session-id`. Emits `claude.session.cleared`. Has no production caller today. |
| `release(session)` | Releases the `turn_lease` and updates `last_used_at` so the reaper measures idle from now. |
| `terminate(memory_node_id)` | Force-drop a specific entry: close stdin → 2s grace → `proc.kill()` → cancel reader/drain tasks. |
| `terminate_conversations(workflow_id, ...)` | Terminate the Context-keyed entries of a workflow (optionally one agent); the Context panel's Clear calls it (reason `conversation_cleared`). |
| `shutdown_all()` | Stop the reaper + terminate every entry. Wire into FastAPI's lifespan `shutdown`. |

Lifecycle policy:

- **Idle TTL** 30 min (`_DEFAULT_IDLE_TTL`). Background reaper task
  terminates pooled sessions whose `last_used_at` exceeds the cap and
  whose `lock` and `turn_lease` are both free.
- **Max size** 16 (`_DEFAULT_MAX_SIZE`). LRU eviction at cap (skipping
  in-flight entries).
- **Concurrency** — the `turn_lease` is held from `acquire` through
  the context rebind, `send_turn` and `release`, so a second batch
  cannot rebind the MCP `BatchContext` after the first batch acquired
  the session but before its turn ran. The narrower `lock` is held
  inside `send_turn` so two calls can't interleave their stream-json
  lines on stdin.

## Stream-json event dispatch

`_handle_stream_event` has three concerns:

1. **UUID capture.** The UUID is normally known from spawn (the minted
   `--session-id` or the `--resume` UUID). Any event carrying
   `session_id` (or `sessionId`) seeds `session.current_session_uuid`
   only if it is still empty (a `--continue` spawn), and `send_turn`
   overwrites it with the `result` event's value at turn end.
   Crash-recovery respawns read this field to emit `--resume <UUID>`.
2. **Per-turn buffering.** Every event is appended to
   `events_this_turn`. When `provider.is_final_event(event)` returns
   True (i.e. `event.type == "result"`), `result_event` is set and
   `send_turn` returns. `SessionResult` is built by
   `AnthropicClaudeProvider.event_to_session_result` over the buffered
   events — same shape `-p` used to produce.
3. **Native compaction forwarding.** `type == "system"` +
   `subtype == "compact_boundary"` events forward to
   `CompactionService.record(...)` via `_record_native_compaction` so
   the local-threshold path doesn't double-fire on claude's auto-
   compaction. Trigger metadata (`pre_tokens`, `trigger: auto|manual`)
   is preserved on the compaction record.

## Continuity across process restarts

The pool's continuity model is two-layered:

- **Intra-process (warm pool).** Within a live subprocess, every turn
  writes to the same `proc.stdin` and claude itself keeps the conversation
  in memory. No `--resume` needed — same session UUID flows across turns.
  Verified: turn 1 `13ac5819-...`, turn 2 same UUID.
- **Cross-process (cold spawn / crash recovery).** A cold spawn with no
  continuity flag mints a `uuid4` and emits `--session-id <UUID>`, so
  the UUID is known before the first event. Memory-bound runs emit
  `--resume <last_session_id>` (the UUID `_persist_memory` stored on the
  memory node after the previous successful run). If `acquire` finds the
  pooled subprocess has died, it splices `--resume <current_session_uuid>`
  into the spec so the new subprocess continues the same on-disk JSONL.
- **Idle reap / LRU eviction / generation change.** `_terminate_locked`
  pops the entry, and its UUID goes with it, so the next `acquire` is a
  plain cold spawn with a new `--session-id`. Memory-bound runs still
  resume through the memory node's `last_session_id`. Context-bound runs
  store no session UUID anywhere, so they start a fresh Claude session
  and keep only the text the context bridge renders into the prompt
  (see "Known gaps").

`ClaudeTaskSpec` carries `session_id`, `resume_session_id` and
`continue_session`; precedence in argv is resume, then continue, then
session-id. `--continue` is never set by the node: the CLI reference says
it skips sessions created non-interactively (`-p` / stream-json input),
which is every session the pool creates, so it silently started a fresh
conversation each batch. A stale `last_session_id` (claude reports
`No conversation found with session ID`) is cleared by `_persist_memory`
so the next run spawns fresh.

## MCP bearer token lifecycle

`claude` handles its own MCP authentication. We embed the bearer in
`--mcp-config` at spawn time; the spawned claude uses it for the
lifetime of its process — the JSON blob (token included) is frozen
into argv and can never be rotated without respawning. The pool
stashes the spawn-time token on
[`PooledClaudeSession.batch_token`](../server/nodes/agent/claude_code_agent/_pool.py)
so subsequent batches can find and update its bound `BatchContext`.

Token lifecycle, three phases:

1. **Cold spawn.** `AICliService.run_batch` issues a fresh token T,
   calls `register_batch(T, ctx)` (which adds T to `_active_tokens`
   and bumps FastMCP refcounts for each `ctx.connected_tools` entry
   via `expose_workflow_tools`), then passes T to `pool.acquire`. The
   pool spawns claude with T baked into `--mcp-config` argv and
   records `session.batch_token = T`.
2. **Warm reuse with a changed surface.** A subsequent batch issues
   a NEW token T_new and registers `ctx_new` against it. Pool
   `acquire` detects warm reuse and calls
   [`rebind_batch`](../server/services/cli_agent/mcp_server.py)
   on T (the persistent token claude bakes into MCP requests),
   transplanting `ctx_new`'s `connected_tools` /
   `connected_skill_names` / `allowed_credentials` /
   `workspace_dir` onto T's `BatchContext` in place. The diff is
   applied to FastMCP — `unexpose_workflow_tools` decrements
   refcounts for tools dropped between batches (so a disconnected
   `duckduckgoSearch` falls off the FastMCP tool list when its
   refcount hits zero), `expose_workflow_tools` increments for
   added tools. T_new is then immediately unregistered (it would
   sit orphaned otherwise — claude's argv never references it).
3. **Termination.** `_terminate_locked` calls `unregister_batch(T)`
   so the dying subprocess's FastMCP refcounts drain cleanly on
   pool eviction / `pool.clear` / `shutdown_all`. Closes the
   long-standing leak where every pooled run permanently incremented
   the refcount of every wired tool.

The per-handler scope check in
[`workflow_tools._build_handler`](../server/services/cli_agent/workflow_tools.py)
reads `ctx.connected_tools` at call time — so even if claude's
frozen `--allowedTools` argv still lists a tool that's since been
disconnected, the handler returns
`{"error": "...not connected to this batch", "status": 403}`.
On the claude side, `--permission-mode dontAsk` denies a call to any
tool that is not pre-approved. The `--allowedTools` list is frozen in
the spawn argv, though: a tool wired after the warm process started is
exposed over MCP by the rebind but is not pre-approved, so claude
denies it until the process is respawned (see "Known gaps").

## CloudEvents broadcasts

Four typed `WorkflowEvent` factories on
[`server/services/events/envelope.py`](../server/services/events/envelope.py),
fired via the corresponding `broadcaster.broadcast_claude_session_*`
methods on
[`server/services/status_broadcaster.py`](../server/services/status_broadcaster.py):

| Event type | When fired |
|---|---|
| `com.opencompany.claude.session.spawned` | Cold spawn (new subprocess) |
| `com.opencompany.claude.session.cleared` | Explicit `pool.clear` → new UUID on next acquire |
| `com.opencompany.claude.session.terminated` | Pool terminate (reason: `idle` / `evicted` / `crashed` / `generation_changed` / `conversation_cleared` / `acquire_failed` / `shutdown` / `explicit`) |
| `com.opencompany.claude.session.usage` | Each `result` event (per-turn cost + tokens + duration + num_turns) |

The usage event is the source of truth for the simpleMemory usage panel
— `/usage` is TUI-only plain text per Anthropic and not parseable.
Frontend listeners switch on `envelope.type` and route the inner `data`
payload (`memory_node_id`, `session_uuid`, cost, tokens, …) into the
store that renders the panel.

## Tools and skills

**Tools (MCP) — pre-approved allowlist, no claude built-ins
pre-approved.** Spawn argv
carries `--mcp-config <json>` (HTTP transport, bearer header) +
`--strict-mcp-config` so the spawned claude only loads OpenCompany's
FastMCP server. The `mcpServers.opencompany` block sets `alwaysLoad:
true` to opt out of MCP tool-search deferral so all
`mcp__opencompany__*` tools enter context at session start.
`--allowedTools` is the explicit pre-approval list, and it does NOT
include claude's built-in escape hatches (`Read`, `Edit`, `Bash`,
`Glob`, `Grep`, `Write`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`) — every workflow
already wires the equivalents (`fileRead`, `fileModify`, `fsSearch`,
`shell`, `browser`, `perplexitySearch`, …) as MCP tools, and the
built-ins were the leakage path that let the agent invoke
capabilities the workflow didn't explicitly grant. The built-ins stay
in the model's context, though: calling them is denied under
`dontAsk`, except read-only Bash commands, which run. The default
allowlist is:

- `mcp__opencompany__<node_type>` per node connected to the agent's
  `input-tools` handle (LLM sees their typed Pydantic schemas via
  FastMCP's `tools/list` reflection on the plugin `Params`).
- The claude built-in `Skill` — **conditional**, present iff at
  least one skill is wired through the agent's `input-skill`
  handle. Paired with the `materialise_skills` helper (below)
  which writes the connected SKILL.md trees under
  `<workspace_dir>/.claude/skills/` (reached through `--add-dir`) so
  the built-in skill loader has something to discover. The one exception to the
  "no claude built-ins" rule, because the alternative (forcing the
  agent to load every skill through the `getSkill` MCP round-trip)
  is materially worse UX for the common case where the workflow
  pre-wired which skills should be on the table.
- The OpenCompany MCP infrastructure tools — `getWorkspaceFiles`,
  `listSkills`, `getSkill`, `readSkillResource`, `searchSkillResource`,
  `getCredential`, `broadcastLog` (listed in
  `AnthropicClaudeProvider.interactive_argv`; defined in
  `mcp_server._build_tools`) — which are how the agent
  reads its workspace, discovers connected skills (when no wiring is
  present), pages through and searches a loaded skill's declared
  resources, fetches scoped credentials, and surfaces intermediate
  progress to the FE.

Callers wanting specific claude built-ins back in opt in per-task via
`ClaudeTaskSpec.allowed_tools` (the field is honored verbatim — no
auto-merge with workflow tools). Default value: empty string.
Combined with `--permission-mode dontAsk`, anything not pre-approved
is denied apart from read-only Bash commands (see "argv shape" above
for why `bypassPermissions` was the wrong default).

**Skills — per-workflow workspace, live-watched, diff-based.**
[`nodes/agent/claude_code_agent/_skills.py::materialise_skills`](../server/nodes/agent/claude_code_agent/_skills.py)
writes one `SKILL.md` tree per connected-and-enabled skill under
`<workspace_dir>/.claude/skills/<name>/`. The workspace dir
(`~/.opencompany/workspaces/<workflow_slug>/` — Wave 14 keys it by the
human-readable slug, not the UUID id) is already passed via
`--add-dir`, and per the skills spec's
[Automatic discovery from parent and nested directories](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#automatic-discovery-from-parent-and-nested-directories)
rule, claude scans `.claude/skills/` inside every `--add-dir` path.
Two properties fall out:

- **Per-workflow isolation.** Workflow A's wired skills never bleed
  into workflow B's subprocess: each runs in its own worktree under its
  own workspace dir.
- **Live add/remove.** Claude live-watches the skills tree (same
  skills spec, [Live change detection](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#live-change-detection)),
  so warm-reuse turns can toggle skills without respawning. Pool's
  `acquire` calls `materialise_skills(workspace_dir, new_set,
  previous_skill_names=session.materialised_skills)` to apply just
  the delta — `rmtree`'d skills disappear from claude's registry,
  newly-written ones become invocable. Same UX win as the MCP tool
  rebind.

Filesystem skills (declared under `server/skills/<group>/<name>/`)
are copied wholesale via `shutil.copytree` so `scripts/` and
`references/` subdirs survive. Database skills (user-created in
the UI) reconstruct the frontmatter (`name`, `description`,
`allowed-tools`, `metadata`) + the markdown body. Failure modes
are non-fatal: a skill that fails to load or write logs at WARN
and is skipped — the spawn continues. The helper is called from
`ClaudeSessionPool._spawn` (cold spawn) and `_prepare_warm_reuse`
(diff on warm reuse); `AICliSession._pre_spawn` still calls it for the
generic path other providers use.

**Migration note.** Pre-cutover code wrote SKILL.md trees into
`<repo_root>/.claude/skills/` so they accumulated in the user's
actual repo. The repo's `.claude/` is gitignored but visible;
future runs only write into per-workflow workspaces. Run
`rm -rf .claude/skills/` once from the repo root to clean
accumulated trees — we deliberately do NOT auto-prune because
the repo's `.claude/` may contain user-authored skills outside
the OpenCompany registry.

**Why filesystem (not MCP).** We surveyed alternatives: MCP
`resources`/`prompts` require explicit `@mention`/`/command`
invocation by the user, not auto-loaded into context. Hooks fire
after skill discovery, not before. `settings.json` doesn't expose
per-session skill paths. Anthropic's own
[Agent SDK](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/skills) uses
the same filesystem-first pattern. There is no programmatic
skill-injection channel — workspace-dir + live-watch is canonical.

**Workspace dir — routed via `--add-dir`.**
[`AICliService.run_batch`](../server/services/cli_agent/service.py)
splices the per-workflow workspace
(`~/.opencompany/workspaces/<workflow_slug>/`, injected into `ctx.raw` by
`workflow.py:_get_workspace_dir`) into each task's `add_dir` list
right after `task_list` is built — `interactive_argv` already emits
`--add-dir <path>` per entry. Runs BEFORE the pool branch so every
pooled session gets it. Without this, the workspace is invisible to
claude: sessions spawn in a git worktree under
`<workspace>/<node>/` (`wt_session` for bound runs, one per task
otherwise), which does not see files dropped by upstream nodes
(`fileDownloader`,
`documentParser`, code executors, etc.). Mirrors the ai_agent
pattern (the tool config built in `AIService.execute_agent` and
`execute_chat_agent` in [`services/ai.py`](../server/services/ai.py) —
`config["workspace_dir"] = context.get("workspace_dir", "")`) but
uses claude's native `--add-dir` instead of MCP-tool-config injection
because claude has its own filesystem tools (`Read`, `Edit`, `Glob`,
`Grep`, `Write`, `Bash`) rather than MCP-injected ones. Verified
end-to-end: a marker file dropped into a workspace is reachable via
claude's `Read` tool inside a pooled turn.

## `/usage` and `/compact` semantics

- **`/usage`** — TUI-only plain text per Anthropic. Not parseable. We
  surface the same data (cost, tokens, duration, num_turns) via the
  `claude.session.usage` CloudEvent built from every `result` event.
- **`/clear`** — the stream-json input wire has no slash-command path
  (confirmed in the VSCode extension source). Context reset is
  `pool.clear(session)` — kill subprocess, drop UUID, next acquire
  spawns fresh.
- **`/compact`** — emits `system/compact_boundary` on stdout with
  `compact_metadata.pre_tokens` + `compact_metadata.trigger` (auto vs
  manual). `_handle_stream_event` forwards it to
  `CompactionService.record(...)` so the local-threshold path doesn't
  double-fire on claude's native auto-compaction.

## Known gaps

Recorded from the code; none is fixed yet, because each fix changes how
the agent runs.

- **Context-bound runs lose Claude's own session after a reap, an
  eviction or a generation change.** The pool entry and its UUID are
  dropped and no UUID is stored for Context-bound runs, so the next run
  is a fresh Claude session. What survives is the stored conversation,
  which holds only each turn's original prompt and final response
  (`SpecializedAgentContextBridge.record_turn`), not tool calls or
  their results.
- **The stored transcript is sent again on every turn.** `run_batch`
  renders the whole stored conversation into the prompt
  (`augment_prompt`) for every Context-bound run, warm or cold. A warm
  process already holds the earlier turns, so it sees each earlier
  exchange again inside every new prompt, and the repeated part grows
  with the conversation. A crash-recovery `--resume` spawn gets the same
  duplication.
- **`--ide` is passed with no lockfile, and the spawn inherits the
  backend's environment.** `_run_pooled_turn` copies `os.environ` whole
  and adds only `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and the
  parent-run ids. When the backend was started from an editor's
  terminal, that editor's variables (including any IDE-integration
  variables) reach the CLI, where `--ide` may act on them. Not verified
  at runtime.
- **`getCredential` and `broadcastLog` are visible to the model and
  pre-approved.** `getCredential` returns the plaintext value of any
  credential named in the node's hidden `allowed_credentials` parameter
  (empty by default, so every call gets a 403); a prompt injection could
  ask for such a key. `broadcastLog` lets the model write lines into the
  Terminal panel. See R5 in
  [cli_agent_canonical_patterns_rfc.md](./cli_agent_canonical_patterns_rfc.md).
- **Warm reuse keeps the spawn-time flags.** `_prepare_warm_reuse`
  rebinds only the MCP `BatchContext` and the materialised skill files.
  `--model`, `--allowedTools` (including whether `Skill` is on it),
  `--permission-mode`, `--append-system-prompt`, `--add-dir` and
  `--effort` stay as they were at spawn until the process is reaped,
  evicted or fenced. A tool, or a first skill, wired after the spawn is
  exposed but not pre-approved, so `dontAsk` denies it. The rebind also
  leaves `connected_skill_descriptors` unchanged, so `getSkill`,
  `readSkillResource` and `searchSkillResource` can work from stale
  skill descriptors.

## What changed (historical note)

The previous iteration of this doc described a PTY transport
(`pywinpty` on Windows, `ptyprocess` on POSIX) reading events from the
on-disk session JSONL via `JsonlWatcher` / `JsonlDirWatcher`. That path
was abandoned for the pool: `pywinpty`'s ConPTY emulation did not
deliver keystrokes to claude's Ink TUI on Windows (empirically
confirmed across four test variants). Stdio pipes + stream-json work
cross-platform and match the pattern the official Agent SDKs use. The
non-pooled `AICliSession` was kept as the plain-run path for a while,
but it never wrote the prompt to the child and a PTY stdin makes the
CLI reject `--input-format stream-json` (GitHub #133 / #134), so
`AICliService.run_batch` now routes every Claude task through the pool:
bound runs get a warm keyed session, unbound runs get an ephemeral
session per task (`<node_id>:<turn_execution_id>:<index>`) terminated
after the batch. A child that exits without a `result` wakes
`send_turn` on stdout EOF with its exit code instead of burning the
turn timeout. The CLI version is pinned via `package_version` in
`config/ai_cli_providers.json` (currently 2.1.258).
